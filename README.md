## discription 
Developed mobile application using flutter framework. Flutter uses the Dart programming language, which is an object-oriented language with a syntax similar to that of Java or C#. Flutter also provides a large selection of customizable widgets and tools for building beautiful and responsive user interfaces.
One of the key features of Flutter is its hot reload feature, which allows you to make changes to your code and see the results in real-time, without having to manually stop and restart the app. This makes it easier to test and iterate on your app during development.
Overall, Flutter is a powerful and easy-to-use framework for developing mobile applications for Android and iOS. Its extensive widget library and hot reload feature make it a popular choice for developers looking to build high-quality, cross-platform apps quickly and efficiently. Therefore, we developed our application using flutter.
We connect our user interface and model using rest API and authentication part developed using firebase.
